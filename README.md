# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview

This analysis aims to study the difference in ride fares in different city types, specifically, the differences in ride fares among rural, suburban, and urban cities. Using the data from PyBer, we plot the ride fare by city types in $USD.



## Result

Urban type cities have the highest count of ride count, and it is more than double the sum of the rural and suburban rides. Rural cities have the lowest count of the ride. (Rural, suburban, and urban have 123, 625, 1625 rides, respectively.) Urban also has the most driver, and rural has the least drivers. (Rural, suburban, and urban have 78, 490, and 2405, respectively.) The average fares for rural, suburban, and urban are $34.62, $30.97, and $24.526, respectively. The total fares are $4327.93, $19356.33, and $39854.38, respectively. The average fare per driver is lowerest in urban cities and highest in rural cities ($55.49, $39.50, and $16.57, respectively) 



We plotted the fares over the month from January to April by the city type. From the plotted graph, we can observe that rural city has the lowerest ride fares, the urban city has the highest ride fares, and the suburban city has ride fares in between the former two. We can also observe a sudden increase in ride fares in all three types of cities at the end of February. However, overall the fares are stable over the months we studied.



## Summary

Based on the result, I can have three business recommendations:

1. To increase the number of drivers in the rural cities. Rural cities and the most expensive average fare with the highest fare for drivers. By increasing the number of the driver, we can lower the average fare per driver and thus decrease the average fare per ride (i.e., increase the supply to decrease the price.)
2. To decrease the number of drivers in urban cities. By decreasing the number of drivers, per driver fare would increase.
3.  If the first recommendation is not feasible, it can be considered to stop operating in the rural city area. The total fares are low in rural areas with high operating costs (i.e. high fare per driver), and thus shutting down services in the area can increase the profit margin.
